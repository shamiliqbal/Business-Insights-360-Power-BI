ðŸš€ Power BI Project Highlight: Comprehensive Performance Dashboard ðŸš€

Excited to share my latest project, where I built an end-to-end analytical solution for monitoring business performance across key dimensions like customers, products, and countries. The solution offers:

âœ… P&L Statement: Dynamic views for any customer, product, or country over any time period, with the ability to aggregate across dimensions.

âœ… Performance Analysis: Deep dives into key metrics such as Net Sales and Gross Margin, with visualizations showing data in profitability/growth matrices.

âœ… Forecasting & Risk Profiling: Accurate forecast metrics like Forecast Accuracy, Net Error, and Risk Profile for various segments, categories, customers, and products.

âœ… Executive Dashboard: A top-level dashboard for executives that consolidates insights from all dimensions of the business, driving strategic decision-making.

ðŸ”§ Tech stack:

Data sourced from MySQL local server
DAX and Power Query used for data modeling
